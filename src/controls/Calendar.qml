    \brief Provides a way to select dates from a calendar

    Calendar allows selection of dates from a grid of days, similar to a typical
    calendar. The selected date can be set through \l selectedDate, or with the
    mouse and directional arrow keys. The current month displayed can be changed
    by clicking the previous and next month buttons, or by navigating with the
    directional keys.

    A minimum and maximum date can be set through \l minimumDate and
    \l maximumDate. The earliest minimum date that can be set is 1 January, 1
    AD. The latest maximum date that can be set is 25 October, 275759 AD.

    Localization is supported through the \l locale property. The selected date
    is displayed according to \l locale, and it can be accessed through the
    \l selectedDateText property.

            \li If selectedDate is equal to \c undefined or some other invalid
                value, it will not be changed.

            \li If there are hours, minutes, seconds or milliseconds set, they
                will be removed.
